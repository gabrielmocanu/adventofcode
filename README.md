# Advent of Code

Advent of code because writing code in December is more exciting.
You can find all the problems [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## 2021

### 1 December

There was 2 problems of measurements. Nothing difficult so I won't go into
details.

### 2 December
The problem was pretty similar with the one in the first day so I don't think
I should explain more on this.

### 3 December
It starting to get funnier and for this problem I need to write some notes.
Most of the notes are in the code but I will add some of them here.
I used Data structure to store every line and ok variable to see if that
line is good(have the most common bit on k line). After one single line
remains available construct decimal number from the binary string.
