# Advent of Code

Advent of code because writing code in December is more exciting.
You can find all the problems [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## 2021

### 1 December

There were 2 problems with measurements. Nothing difficult so I won't go into
details.

### 2 December
The problem was pretty similar to the one on the first day so I don't think
I should explain more on this.

### 3 December
It starting to get funnier and for this problem, I need to write some notes.
Most of the notes are in the code but I will add some of them here.
I used Data structure to store every line and ok variable to see if that
line is good(have the most common bit on k line). After one single line
remains available construct a decimal number from the binary string.

### 4 December
Neither hard nor easy. The input was a bit fucked up from my point of view, but
the task wasn't so difficult. For the second problem to make it a bit cleaner
and faster I added 2 more fields in the structure.

### 5 December
Good Sunday. Nothing too hard for today, the code explains itself.

### 6 December
For the first time this December I need to change all parts of the first problem
in order to solve the second one, even though the problem was the same, only
the input was different. For the first part, I used an array to represent all
fish and their status. Iterate through the array and simulate every day.
For the second part, I could not use the same method because the array became very large,
after `256` days it became a lot of fish that could not be represented in an array,
be it static or dynamic. For this problem, I used another array to represent each status
for a fish. For example, if we have 15 fish with status 3, then `days[3] = 15`. In this
way we can represent in a smarter way.


### 7 December
I checked only the position between [0, max(array)] because otherwise, the fuel
will not be minimum. For each position, I calculated the fuel and pick the 
minimum one. Pretty intuitive problem.


### 8 December
TBD

### 9 December
For the first problem was pretty simple, but for the second I had to use 
a recursive function to count every number from a basis.


### 10 December
This problem was very similar with the known valid parenthesses problem.
There is nothing special that I did.
